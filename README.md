I followed several tutorials in order to garner a better understanding of the blockchain.

In the first tutorial, I built a Hello World voting application locally on a test Ethereum network, with full decentralized functionality

In the second tutorial, I utilized Remix IDE in order to build a smart contract using Ethereum; unfortunately I was unable to get the full front end running locally even though my smart contract was fully functional in the online IDE

Finally, I built a blockchain using Python to understand the nature of the decentralized ledger that forms the basis for the cryptocurrencies, and their associated craze today!

Apologies for the piecemeal approach to the Hack-a-thing assignment: rather than simply targeting one tutorial, I wanted to sample several facets of the the blockchain to facilitate a better understanding for when project time comes around.
